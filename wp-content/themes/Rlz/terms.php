              <p class="style1">Herbal Safety 
			Guidelines</p>
              <p class="style2">Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs for health purposes. For maximum effectiveness, herbs must be used according to product dosage and other instructions. For example, consuming a greater amount than the recommended dosage may not produce better results.. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following are some guidelines for using herbs, including the ones offered on our websites. </p>
              <p class="style1">Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a supplement?</p>
                <p class="style2">This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.</p>
              <p class="style1">Some supplements may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.</p>
                <p class="style2">Taking a combination of supplements or using these products together with medications (whether prescription or OTC drugs) could under certain circumstances produce adverse effects. Be alert to advisories about these products, whether taken alone or in combination. For example: Coumadin (a prescription medicine), ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin (an OTC drug) and vitamin E (a vitamin supplement) can each thin the blood, and taking any of these products together can increase the potential for internal bleeding.  Consult with your physician or other health care provider about any possible adverse interactive effects involving supplements and medications that you may be taking. </p>
              <p class="style3">Some supplements can have unwanted effects during surgery.</p>
                <p class="style2">It is important to fully inform your doctor about the vitamins, minerals, herbals or any other supplements you are taking, especially before elective surgery. You may be asked to stop taking these products at least 2-3 weeks ahead of the procedure to avoid potentially dangerous supplement/drug interactions -- such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure and increased bleeding - that could adversely affect the outcome of your surgery.</p>
              <p class="style1"> 9.  Legal Disclaimer</p>
